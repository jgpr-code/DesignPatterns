# DesignPatterns

In this Solution I want to explore Design Patterns again in OOP style (C#) but also in FP style (F#).
I hope the comparison of how those patterns can look in those two languages is somewhat beneficial.

I started this project initially, because of this [talk](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/fppatterns/)
